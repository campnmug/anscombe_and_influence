Lecture on the fun of residuals
Anscombe's Quarted is four datasets that each yield the same exact regression results, however three of the data sets are seriously flawed. The lesson is that just because a regression looks good, e.g., has a high R-squared, does not mean its not worthless. 

I think the Anscombe data and its lessons are fun, hence i refer to this as the fun dataset.
